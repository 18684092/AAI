# Description   : Config File for assignment 1
# Format        : parameter:value

# Commands are "common:", "File:" which choose the dictionaries the variables will
# be entered into and have no variable value. These sit on a line by themselves.

# All variables will be converted to lowercase, their values will not be.

# Possible variables are LearnFile, TestFile, Given, Out, Log, Laplacian, logging
# Display, Question

# Comment lines start with #
# Blank lines are ignored

# Task 1 - Naive Bayes

# Common means variables for all models and or the program itself
Common:

# Note MUST use Laplacian if Log
Log:True
LaplacianSimple:False
LaplacianSmoothe:True
Simple:0.000001
Laplacian:1
